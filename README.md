## Refactoring Project

This project was intended to learn and practice refactoring. 
We learned how to use semantic elements in HTML to clean up the non-semantic div elements in the original HTML and make the code easier to read and understand should someone else need look at it in the future. 
We also cleaned up duplicate code in the CSS and edited the classes to match the new semantic elements in the HTML.
